**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report security issues privately via [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/talktoajayprakash/skillsmanager/security/advisories/new), or email the maintainer directly at the address in `package.json`.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue

## Response timeline

- **Acknowledgement**: within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: within 5 business days
- **Patch for critical issues**: within 14 days of confirmation

## Scope

Skills Manager is a CLI tool with no server component. The main security-relevant areas are:

- **OAuth token storage** — tokens are stored at `~/.skillsmanager/token.json` with file-system permissions
- **Google Drive API access** — scoped to files created by the app (`drive.file` scope)
- **Skill content execution** — Skills Manager does not execute skill files; it only reads and symlinks them. Execution is handled by the target agent.

Out of scope: social engineering, phishing, issues in third-party dependencies that have already been publicly disclosed.
