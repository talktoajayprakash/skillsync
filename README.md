# Skills Manager

**One place to manage, sync, and share all your AI agent skills — across every agent you use.**

You build skills for your AI agents, but keeping track of them is a mess. They're scattered across GitHub repos, local folders, and machines. Each agent has its own directory. Nothing is searchable. Nothing is shared.

Skills Manager fixes this. It gives every skill a home — in Google Drive, GitHub, or any storage backend you choose — and makes them instantly available to any agent via a single CLI command. Your agents can search, fetch, and use any skill regardless of where it lives.

Build skills confidently, store them where you want, and sync them across every device and agent you work with.

## Why Skills Manager?

- **Unified skill library** — one searchable index across all your skills, wherever they're stored
- **Cross-agent** — install any skill into Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini, and more
- **Backend-agnostic** — store in Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox, AWS S3, or local filesystem
- **Sync across devices** — skills follow you, not your machine
- **No duplication** — cached once locally, symlinked into each agent's directory
- **Git-friendly** — plain Markdown files, easy to version-control and review

## Supported Agents

`claude` · `codex` · `cursor` · `windsurf` · `copilot` · `gemini` · `roo` · `agents`

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g @skillsmanager/cli
```

### 2. Install the skillsmanager skill (lets your agent drive Skills Manager)

```bash
skillsmanager install
```

This installs the bundled `skillsmanager` skill into all detected agents so your AI assistant can manage skills on your behalf.

### 3. One-time Google Drive setup

Skills Manager uses Google Drive as a remote registry. To connect it:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** for that project
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (Desktop app type)
4. Download `credentials.json` and save it to `~/.skillsmanager/credentials.json`

Then authenticate and discover your registries:

```bash
skillsmanager setup google   # walks you through OAuth
skillsmanager refresh        # discovers collections in your Drive
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `skillsmanager install` | Install the skillsmanager skill to all agents |
| `skillsmanager list` | List all available skills |
| `skillsmanager search <query>` | Search skills by name or description |
| `skillsmanager fetch <name> --agent <agent>` | Download and install a skill for an agent |
| `skillsmanager add <path>` | Upload a local skill to a collection |
| `skillsmanager update <path>` | Push local changes back to remote storage |
| `skillsmanager refresh` | Re-discover collections from remote |
| `skillsmanager collection create` | Create a new skill collection |
| `skillsmanager registry push --backend gdrive` | Push local registry to Google Drive |

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talktoajayprakash/skillsmanager.git
cd skillsmanager
npm install
npm run build       # compiles TypeScript to dist/
npm link            # makes `skillsmanager` available globally from source
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run without installing globally:

```bash
node dist/index.js <command>
```

## Registry format

Skills are indexed by a `SKILLS_REGISTRY.yaml` file inside any Google Drive folder you own:

```yaml
name: my-skills
owner: you@example.com
skills:
  - name: code-review
    path: code-review/
    description: Reviews code for bugs, style, and security issues
```

Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code for bugs, style, and security issues
---

... skill instructions ...
```

Skills Manager auto-discovers any `SKILLS_REGISTRY.yaml` in your Google account on `refresh`.
